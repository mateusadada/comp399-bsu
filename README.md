## 🚀 Starting

This project was developed as part of the 3D Animation course, focusing on practical modeling exercises and understanding the mathematical and physical concepts behind transformations in 3D environments. The main goal is to provide a solid foundation for understanding object movement and manipulation within the Unity game engine.

## 📚 Features

Key aspects covered during development:
- Simple 3D modeling exercises to practice object transformations.
- Application of mathematical concepts such as vectors, matrices, and transformations.
- Implementation of basic physical laws for object movement and interaction.
- C# scripts to control and manipulate movements within the Unity environment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

To use this project, create a new Unity project (recommended version: 6000.2.9f1 or above) and import the files located in the **Assets** folder. No external libraries are required besides Unity itself.

## 🛠️ Built with

* [Unity](https://unity.com/) - Game engine used for project development, 3D object manipulation, and transformation handling.
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - Programming language used to create the scripts that control movement logic and interactions within Unity.
